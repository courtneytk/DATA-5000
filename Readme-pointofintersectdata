From the existing concept - the Point of Intersect Data


Mission of the project
The purpose of this project is to enhance and increase community resilience by identifying a structured and resilience-based land use reconfiguration schemes using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as machine learning. We will be focusing on the issues that have not been addressed in an urban context collectively before. The presented LTSG dataset is a collection of geographical and transportation data, containing Points of Interest (POIs), HDB buildings and public transportation data of Singapore. 

 The POI data contains data points of places that people have an interest in visiting for a certain purpose, which include but not limited to educational institutes such as schools or libraries, shopping places such as supermarkets or convenience stores, recreational places such as parks or bars. Generally speaking, the POI data can tell us what kind of activities are happening at the location. The HDB data contains data points of apartment buildings where people reside. In short, the HDB data shows where people are staying, while the POI data shows where people are visiting. Every day, people travel between these locations, forming a certain connection between them. With the bus routing data, the bus ridership data and the subway routing data, we hope to provide information on the system that supports these travels. Thus, this dataset has the potential to be used by researchers in the field for many different tasks that require knowledge of transport, recreational, commercial and residential information of a city, especially to explore their influence on each other. 

Data Sources
